# Privacy Policy for Dandelion

**Effective Date:** February 7, 2026

## Our Promise

Dandelion is built on a simple principle: your thoughts are yours to release, not ours to keep. When you write in Dandelion and let your words go, they disappear completely. We mean it.

## What We Don't Collect

**Your Writing:** The text you write is never uploaded to any server, account, or cloud service. When you release your words, the writing is discarded. We do not keep or transmit your journal text.

## What We Store (On Your Device, in iCloud, and as Anonymous Aggregates)

To make the app work, Dandelion stores a small amount of data locally on your device. If you are signed in to iCloud and iCloud Sync is enabled in Dandelion, the following can sync through Apple’s CloudKit to your other devices:

- **Release history metadata:** timestamps and word counts for each release.
- **Prompt preferences:** your custom prompts and which default prompts are enabled.

Other preferences (such as appearance, haptics, and reminder settings) are stored locally on each device. Bloom purchase state is handled by Apple App Store entitlements.

Separately, if **Contribute to Global Stats** is enabled (enabled by default when iCloud is available, opt-out in Settings), Dandelion writes anonymous aggregate usage data to CloudKit's public database:

- How many releases happened
- How many words were released
- The hour window when those totals occurred

This global stats data does **not** include your writing text, prompts, account identifiers, device identifiers, or release content.

## In-App Purchases

If you choose to unlock premium features through a one-time purchase:
- Apple handles the transaction through the App Store
- We receive only confirmation that the purchase was made
- We don't collect or store your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy governs that transaction

## Microphone Access

Dandelion requests access to your microphone so you can blow into your device to release your words. When you blow:
- Audio is processed locally on your device only
- We detect the sound of you blowing, not your voice or words
- No audio is recorded, saved, or transmitted anywhere
- You can deny microphone access and use the manual release option instead

## Device Permissions

Dandelion may request these optional permissions:
- **Microphone access** for blow-to-release.
- **Notification permission** for daily release reminders.

You can use Dandelion without granting either permission.

## Third-Party Services

Dandelion uses no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs. Cloud storage and sync are provided by Apple CloudKit.

## iCloud and Global Stats

If you are signed in to iCloud, Dandelion uses Apple’s CloudKit for:

1. **Private sync data** (release history metadata and prompt preferences) in your iCloud account for cross-device sync.
2. **Anonymous global aggregates** (release and word-count totals) in CloudKit public database records.

Private sync data is:

- Stored in your personal iCloud account
- Encrypted and protected by Apple’s iCloud security
- Not accessible to the Dandelion team
- Not used for analytics or advertising

Anonymous global aggregate records are used only to calculate global totals shown in the app.

If iCloud is unavailable on your device, global stats contribution is disabled until iCloud becomes available.

## Children's Privacy

Dandelion does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app stores only the limited metadata described in this policy and optional anonymous global aggregate counters.

## Data Security

Since your writing is not uploaded or stored remotely, there is no server-side data to secure or breach related to your text. The limited metadata and settings described above remain on your device and, if enabled, in your iCloud account. Anonymous global aggregate counters are stored in CloudKit public database records.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your experience:
- You can delete Dandelion at any time to remove its on-device data
- You can opt out of anonymous global stats contribution in Settings at any time
- No account means nothing to close or data to request

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how Dandelion works in a way that affects your privacy, we'll update this policy and notify you through the app. You'll always have the choice to accept changes or stop using the app.

**The Bottom Line:** Dandelion exists to help you let go. We take that seriously. Your thoughts are released into nothing, seen by no one, stored nowhere. That's our promise.
