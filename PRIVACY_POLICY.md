# Privacy Policy for Dandelion

**Effective Date:** February 2, 2026

## Our Promise

Dandelion is built on a simple principle: your thoughts are yours to release, not ours to keep. When you write in Dandelion and let your words go, they disappear completely. We mean it.

## What We Don't Collect

**Your Writing:** The text you write is never uploaded to any server, account, or cloud service. When you release your words, the writing is discarded. We do not keep or transmit your journal text.

## What We Do Store (On Your Device Only)

To make the app work, Dandelion stores a small amount of data locally on your device:

- **Release history metadata:** timestamps and word counts for each release.
- **Prompt preferences:** your custom prompts and which default prompts are enabled.
- **Settings:** app preferences such as appearance and haptics.
- **Purchase state:** whether premium is unlocked.

This information stays on your device. We do not operate any servers that receive this data.

## In-App Purchases

If you choose to unlock premium features through a one-time purchase:
- Apple handles the transaction through the App Store
- We receive only confirmation that the purchase was made
- We don't collect or store your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy governs that transaction

## Microphone Access

Dandelion requests access to your microphone so you can blow into your device to release your words. When you blow:
- Audio is processed locally on your device only
- We detect the sound of you blowing, not your voice or words
- No audio is recorded, saved, or transmitted anywhere
- You can deny microphone access and use the manual release option instead

## Device Permissions

The only permission Dandelion requests is microphone access for the blow-to-release feature. This is optional — you can use Dandelion fully without granting this permission.

## Third-Party Services

Dandelion uses no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Your experience is private and unmonitored.

## Children's Privacy

Dandelion does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect data at all, the app is safe for all ages.

## Data Security

Since your writing is not uploaded or stored remotely, there is no server-side data to secure or breach. The limited metadata and settings described above remain on your device.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your experience:
- You can delete Dandelion at any time to remove its on-device data
- No account means nothing to close or data to request

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how Dandelion works in a way that affects your privacy, we'll update this policy and notify you through the app. You'll always have the choice to accept changes or stop using the app.

**The Bottom Line:** Dandelion exists to help you let go. We take that seriously. Your thoughts are released into nothing, seen by no one, stored nowhere. That's our promise.
