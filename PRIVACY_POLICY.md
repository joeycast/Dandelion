# Privacy Policy for Dandelion

**Effective Date:** January 4, 2026

## Our Promise

Dandelion is built on a simple principle: your thoughts are yours to release, not ours to keep. When you write in Dandelion and let your words go, they disappear completely. We mean it.

## What We Don't Collect

**Your Writing:** Nothing you write in Dandelion is ever saved, stored, transmitted, or seen by anyone but you. When you release your words, they're gone forever. We have no servers storing your journal entries, no databases with your thoughts, no backups of your writing. It simply doesn't exist once you let it go.

## What We Do Collect

**Nothing.** Dandelion works entirely on your device without requiring an account, login, or any personal information.

## In-App Purchases

If you choose to unlock premium features through a one-time purchase:
- Apple handles the transaction through the App Store
- We receive only confirmation that the purchase was made
- We don't collect or store your payment information
- Apple's privacy policy governs that transaction

## Microphone Access

Dandelion requests access to your microphone so you can blow into your device to release your words. When you blow:
- Audio is processed locally on your device only
- We detect the sound of you blowing, not your voice or words
- No audio is recorded, saved, or transmitted anywhere
- You can deny microphone access and use the manual release option instead

## Device Permissions

The only permission Dandelion requests is microphone access for the blow-to-release feature. This is optional — you can use Dandelion fully without granting this permission.

## Third-Party Services

Dandelion currently uses no third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. Your experience is private and unmonitored.

## Children's Privacy

Dandelion does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect data at all, the app is safe for all ages.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or store your writing or personal information, there's no data to secure or breach. Your words exist only in the moment you write them, then disappear when released.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your experience:
- Nothing is collected without your knowledge
- You can delete Dandelion at any time
- No account means nothing to close or data to request

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how Dandelion works in a way that affects your privacy, we'll update this policy and notify you through the app. You'll always have the choice to accept changes or stop using the app.

**The Bottom Line:** Dandelion exists to help you let go. We take that seriously. Your thoughts are released into nothing, seen by no one, stored nowhere. That's our promise.
