A journaling app where nothing is saved. Write your thoughts, blow them away like dandelion seeds, and feel the release.

## Medium Description (Landing Page)
Your mind is full. Dandelion gives you a beautiful space to write it all out—then let it go completely. Put your thoughts into words, blow gently into your phone, and watch them scatter like dandelion pappuses drifting into nothing. No saving. No storing. No looking back. Just release.

## Longer Description (About Section)
Sometimes you need to get thoughts out of your head, not into a journal. Dandelion is designed for those moments—when you need to release, not remember.

Write freely in a distraction-free space. When you're ready, blow gently into your device and watch your words drift away like dandelion seeds on the wind. They're gone completely. We don't save them. We don't store them. They simply disappear.

The act of writing becomes purely cathartic. No pressure to craft perfect entries. No anxiety about who might read them someday. Just you, your thoughts, and the satisfying release of letting them go.

## App Store Description Opening
**Your thoughts don't need to be saved. Sometimes they just need to be released.**

Dandelion is a different kind of journal. You write to let go, not to keep. Put your racing thoughts into words, then blow them away like dandelion seeds on the wind.

Nothing you write is ever saved. Not on your phone. Not in the cloud. Nowhere. When you release your words, they're gone forever—and that's exactly the point.
