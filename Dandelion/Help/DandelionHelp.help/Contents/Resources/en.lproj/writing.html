    <h1>Writing & Releasing</h1>
    <p>The heart of Dandelion is the simple act of writing and letting go. This page explains how it works.</p>

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>When you open Dandelion, you'll see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A gentle <strong>dandelion</strong> swaying in the breeze</li>
      <li>A <strong>prompt</strong> to inspire your writing (or simply "What's on your mind?")</li>
      <li>A <strong>Begin Writing</strong> button that presents a writing view</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Write as much or as little as you like. There's no minimum or maximum—even a single word counts.</p>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip</strong>
      Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or making sense. This is for you, and no one else will ever read it.
    </div>

    <h2>Releasing</h2>
    <p>When you're ready to let your words go, you have two options:</p>

    <h3>Blow to Release</h3>
    <p>Gently blow into your device's microphone. Dandelion listens for the sound of your breath and triggers the release when it detects a blow. This creates a more physical, intentional experience of letting go.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note</strong>
      You'll need to grant microphone permission the first time. If you'd rather not use the microphone, you can always use the manual release option.
    </div>

    <h3>Manual Release</h3>
    <p>Click or tap the <strong>Let Go</strong> button to let your words go without using the microphone. This is just as valid—the important thing is the intention, not the method.</p>

    <h2>The Release Animation</h2>
    <p>When you release:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your words transform into tiny dandelion seeds (called pappus)</li>
      <li>The seeds drift and scatter across the screen</li>
      <li>A gentle message appears acknowledging your release</li>
      <li>Everything fades away</li>
      <li>The dandelion restores its seeds, ready for next time</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>After Releasing</h2>
    <p>Once your words have drifted away, they're gone forever. Dandelion records only:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That a release happened</li>
      <li>When it happened</li>
      <li>How many words you wrote</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can then write again immediately, or close the app and return later.</p>

    <h2>Prompts</h2>
    <p>Each time you open Dandelion or complete a release, you'll see a new prompt. These are designed to gently inspire reflection without being prescriptive.</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the prompt if it resonates</li>
      <li>Ignore it completely and write whatever you want</li>
      <li>Customize which prompts appear in <a href="settings.html">Settings</a></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip</strong>
      If you prefer a blank slate, you can disable prompts entirely in Settings &gt; Prompts.
