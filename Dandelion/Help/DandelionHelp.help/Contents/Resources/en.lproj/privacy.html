    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>Privacy isn't just a feature of Dandelion—it's the foundation. Your thoughts are yours alone.</p>

    <h2>Your Words Are Never Saved</h2>
    <p>This is the core promise of Dandelion: <strong>your words exist only in the moment</strong>. When you release, your text is transformed into the visual animation and then discarded. It's not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Saved to your device</li>
      <li>Uploaded to any server</li>
      <li>Stored in any database</li>
      <li>Backed up anywhere</li>
      <li>Logged or recorded in any form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you see those seeds drift away, your words are truly gone.</p>

    <div class="important">
      <strong>This is intentional</strong>
      The ephemeral nature of Dandelion is by design. It lets you write without self-censorship, knowing that your words won't come back to haunt you or be discovered by anyone.
    </div>

    <h2>What We Store</h2>
    <p>To provide History, Insights, and prompt customization features, Dandelion stores minimal metadata on your device. If iCloud Sync is enabled in Dandelion, this data can sync across your devices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timestamp</strong> — When the release happened</li>
      <li><strong>Word count</strong> — How many words you wrote</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt preferences</strong> — Your custom prompts and which default prompts are enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This sync data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account.</p>
    <p>Other preferences (like appearance, haptics, and reminder settings) are stored locally per device. Bloom purchase state is handled by Apple App Store entitlements.</p>

    <h2>Anonymous Global Stats</h2>
    <p>If <strong>Contribute to Global Stats</strong> is enabled (enabled by default when iCloud is available, opt-out in Settings), Dandelion writes anonymous aggregate usage totals to CloudKit's public database so the app can show community totals.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How many releases happened</strong></li>
      <li><strong>How many words were released</strong></li>
      <li><strong>The hour window when those totals occurred</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These records do not include your writing text, prompt content, account identifiers, or device identifiers.</p>

    <h2>No Third-Party Tracking</h2>
    <p>Dandelion has no third-party analytics or ad tracking. We don't:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect analytics about your usage</li>
      <li>Track your behavior</li>
      <li>Use ad networks or profiling SDKs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cloud storage and sync are handled by Apple CloudKit.</p>

    <h2>iCloud and CloudKit</h2>
    <p>If you're signed in to iCloud, Dandelion uses CloudKit for private sync data and for anonymous global aggregates used in the in-app global counters.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Private sync data is stored in your personal iCloud account</li>
      <li>Anonymous aggregate totals are stored in CloudKit public database records</li>
      <li>Private sync data is not accessible to the Dandelion team</li>
      <li>Both are subject to Apple's privacy and security protections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If iCloud is unavailable, global stats contribution is automatically disabled until iCloud is available again.</p>

    <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>Dandelion can optionally use your microphone to detect when you blow to release. This audio:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is processed entirely on your device</li>
      <li>Is never recorded or stored</li>
      <li>Is never transmitted anywhere</li>
      <li>Is only used to detect the blow gesture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can deny microphone access and use the manual release button instead. The experience is just as meaningful.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>Dandelion can optionally send local daily reminders to help you return and release. These notifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are scheduled on-device</li>
      <li>Use curated app copy, not your writing text</li>
      <li>Can be disabled any time in Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purchases</h2>
    <p>Dandelion Bloom purchases are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We don't collect or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about privacy in Dandelion, please reach out through the app's feedback option or visit our website.</p>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Our philosophy</strong>
      We built Dandelion because we believe some thoughts are meant to be released, not recorded. Your mind deserves a safe space to process without permanence.
