    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>Privacy isn't just a feature of Dandelion—it's the foundation. Your thoughts are yours alone.</p>

    <h2>Your Words Are Never Saved</h2>
    <p>This is the core promise of Dandelion: <strong>your words exist only in the moment</strong>. When you release, your text is transformed into the visual animation and then discarded. It's not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Saved to your device</li>
      <li>Uploaded to any server</li>
      <li>Stored in any database</li>
      <li>Backed up anywhere</li>
      <li>Logged or recorded in any form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you see those seeds drift away, your words are truly gone.</p>

    <div class="important">
      <strong>This is intentional</strong>
      The ephemeral nature of Dandelion is by design. It lets you write without self-censorship, knowing that your words won't come back to haunt you or be discovered by anyone.
    </div>

    <h2>What We Do Store</h2>
    <p>To provide History, Insights, and prompt customization features, Dandelion stores minimal metadata on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timestamp</strong> — When the release happened</li>
      <li><strong>Word count</strong> — How many words you wrote</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt preferences</strong> — Your custom prompts and which default prompts are enabled</li>
      <li><strong>Settings</strong> — App preferences like appearance and haptics</li>
      <li><strong>Reminder preferences</strong> — Whether daily reminders are enabled and your selected reminder time</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase state</strong> — Whether premium is unlocked</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it. This data is stored locally on your device and synced via iCloud to your other devices (if you use iCloud).</p>

    <h2>No Servers</h2>
    <p>Dandelion has no backend servers. We don't:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect analytics about your usage</li>
      <li>Track your behavior</li>
      <li>Store any data about you</li>
      <li>Have any way to access your information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything stays on your devices and in your personal iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>If you're signed in to iCloud, your on-device metadata (release history, prompt preferences, settings, and purchase state) syncs between your devices using CloudKit. This data is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stored in your personal iCloud account</li>
      <li>Not accessible to us or anyone else</li>
      <li>Subject to Apple's privacy protections</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>Dandelion can optionally use your microphone to detect when you blow to release. This audio:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is processed entirely on your device</li>
      <li>Is never recorded or stored</li>
      <li>Is never transmitted anywhere</li>
      <li>Is only used to detect the blow gesture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can deny microphone access and use the manual release button instead. The experience is just as meaningful.</p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>Dandelion can optionally send local daily reminders to help you return and release. These notifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are scheduled on-device</li>
      <li>Use curated app copy, not your writing text</li>
      <li>Can be disabled any time in Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purchases</h2>
    <p>Dandelion Bloom purchases are handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We don't collect or store any payment information.</p>

    <h2>Questions?</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about privacy in Dandelion, please reach out through the app's feedback option or visit our website.</p>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Our philosophy</strong>
      We built Dandelion because we believe some thoughts are meant to be released, not recorded. Your mind deserves a safe space to process without permanence.
