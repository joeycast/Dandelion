    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>Dandelion helps you process thoughts by writing them down and then letting them go. Unlike traditional journals, nothing is saved—your words exist only in the moment.</p>

    <h2>The Dandelion Ritual</h2>
    <p>Using Dandelion is simple and intentional:</p>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <strong>Write freely</strong><br>
        When you open Dandelion, you'll see a gentle prompt and a place to write. Type whatever comes to mind—there's no wrong way to do this.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Release your words</strong><br>
        When you're ready to let go, blow gently into your Mac's microphone or click the Let Go button. Your words transform into dandelion seeds and drift away.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Return refreshed</strong><br>
        The dandelion restores itself, a new prompt appears, and you can write again—or simply close the app and carry on with your day.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Tip</strong>
      You don't need to write a lot. Even a single sentence can be meaningful to release.
    </div>

    <h2>What Gets Saved</h2>
    <p>Dandelion never stores your actual words. After each release, we only remember:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The date and time of your release</li>
      <li>How many words you wrote</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This lets you track your journey and see patterns over time, while keeping your thoughts completely private.</p>

    <h2>Quick Navigation</h2>
    <p>On Mac, use the sidebar or keyboard shortcuts to move between views:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> — History</li>
      <li><kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> — Insights</li>
      <li><kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> — Settings</li>
    </ul>
