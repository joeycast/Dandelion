    <h1>History & Insights</h1>
    <p>While Dandelion never saves your words, it does track when you release and how much you wrote. This helps you see patterns and stay motivated.</p>

    <h2>History View</h2>
    <p>The History view shows your release activity over time. Access it by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking <strong>History</strong> in the sidebar (Mac)</li>
      <li>Pressing <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Calendar View</h3>
    <p>The calendar shows which days you've released. Days with releases are marked with a dandelion icon.</p>

    <h2>Insights <span class="premium-badge">Bloom</span></h2>
    <p>Insights give you a deeper look at your writing patterns. Access it by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking <strong>Insights</strong> in the sidebar (Mac)</li>
      <li>Pressing <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note</strong>
      Full Insights are part of Dandelion Bloom. Without Bloom, you can see your total releases and words, but detailed analytics are blurred.
    </div>

    <h2>Exporting Your Data <span class="premium-badge">Bloom</span></h2>
    <p>With Dandelion Bloom, you can export your release history:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share Summary</strong> — A text summary of your journey</li>
      <li><strong>Export CSV</strong> — A spreadsheet with dates, times, and word counts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Look for the share icon in the Insights toolbar.</p>

    <div class="important">
      <strong>Remember</strong>
      Exports include dates and word counts only—never your actual words. Those are gone forever, as intended.
    </div>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>Your release history syncs across all your devices via iCloud. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Release on your iPhone, see it on your Mac</li>
      <li>Your streaks and insights stay current everywhere</li>
      <li>If you get a new device, your history comes with you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>iCloud sync happens automatically when you're signed in to iCloud.</p>
