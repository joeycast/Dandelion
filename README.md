# Dandelion

Your thoughts don't always need to be saved.
Sometimes they just need to be released.

Dandelion is a different kind of journal. You write to let go, not to keep. Put your
racing thoughts into words, then blow them away like dandelion seeds in the wind.

Nothing you write is ever saved. Not on your phone. Not in the cloud. Nowhere. When
you release your words, they're gone forever - and that's exactly the point.
